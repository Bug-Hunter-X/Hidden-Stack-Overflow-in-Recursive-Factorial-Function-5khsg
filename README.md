This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Hack function that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The function works correctly for positive input values but causes a stack overflow error if a negative number is provided as input. The error is not immediately obvious, making it a good example of a less common type of runtime error that can be tricky to identify and debug.  The bugSolution.hack file provides a corrected version of the function.
